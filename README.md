# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
Tweaking CNN models for handwritten digit recognition in Indian vernacular languages

Handwritten digit classification is a well-known and important problem in the field of optical character recognition (OCR).
The primary challenge is correctly classifying digits which are highly varied in their visual characteristics due to the
writing styles of different individuals. In this project, I have tried different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
the purpose of classifying handwritten Bangla and Hindi numerals. The major advantage of using a CNN based classifier is
that no prior hand-crafted feature is necessary. Tests on rotational invariance of CNNs using modified training and test sets
have also been carried out.

Applications can be found in real-time OCR systems where input images are often not perfectly oriented along a vertical axis.
